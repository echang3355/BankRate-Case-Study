# BankRate-Case-Study

In this case study, I look to find insights for a banking company that specializes in personal loans and use my findings to help maximize approval rate and revenue. Some tools I used in this project are SQL to do exlorative data analysis, Tableau for data visualizations, and Google sheets to bring my findings together to present to the team.
